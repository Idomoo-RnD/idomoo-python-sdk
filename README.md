Idomoo's API is designed for developers or anyone whoâ€™s comfortable creating custom-coded solutions.
The API is designed using standard HTTP (RESTful) protocols and can be implemented using a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
This is a python implementation of the above API.

- API version: 2.0
- Package version: 0.0.1-beta (This means that both the API and client are subject to changes)

## Installation & Usage

### pip install


```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Idomoo-RnD/idomoo-python-sdk.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com//.git`)

## Getting Started

### Creating the client 

#### Using The configuration object
We allow 2 ways to initiate the basic configuration object

1) Using Env variables:

* IDOMOO_API_REGION - (USA/EUR)
* IDOMOO_ACCOUNT_ID
* IDOMOO_API_SECRET_KEY

```python
import idomoo
configuration = idomoo.Configuration()
client = idomoo.IdomooClient(configuration=configuration)
```

2) In the code
```python
import idomoo
config = idomoo.Configuration()
config.api_secret_key = "SECRETE_KEY"
config.account_id = "ACCOUNT_ID"
config.region = "USA"
pv = idomoo.IdomooClient(configuration=config)
```
## Documentation for API Endpoints

[Generate API](docs/GenerateApi.md)

[Metadata API](docs/MetadataApi.md)

## Security
